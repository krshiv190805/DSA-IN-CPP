    now we are starting trees
    it contains a root , children , leaf node
    first node is called the root
    and branches node is called children
    and a node which don't have any children is called a leaf node
    ancestor is all the nodes which are present above it and should be interconnected to each other
    5 types of binary trees are there
    1)full binary tree-either has 0 or 2 children
    2)complete bt-1)all levels are completely filled except the last level, 2) the last level has all the nodes in left as possible
    3)perfect bt-all leaf nodes are the same level
    4)balanced bt-height of tree at maximum should be log(N) , if N=8 so only log 8 base 2=3
    5)degenerate tree- means skew tree means only one sided it should be(basically a linked list-where every node has a single children)

   above one is example of a degenerate tree
