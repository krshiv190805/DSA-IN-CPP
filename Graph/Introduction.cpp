 /*two types of graph are there , one is directed other is undirected 
there is node(or vertex) as one term, and in directed we have bidirectional edges as well,
we are saying the array pointing from one node(/vertex) to another as edges 
if you travel in a square but not completing its one edge then it is said to be directed acylic graph(DAG)
there should not be two same node in a path
degree of a node is (for undirected graph) is the no of nodes which are attached to it
keynote:: total degree of a graph=2*(no. of edges ) 
In_degree=no of incoming edges to a node(in directed graph)
Out_degree=no of outgoing edges to a node (in directed graph)
something is there which we call as edge weight , weight of an edge(they can assign you any value)
note:: if not assigned any weight take it as unit weight*/
