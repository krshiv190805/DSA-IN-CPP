/*
in this we will be given two types of any of the pre,post, inorder traversal
and we have to tell whether it is possible to construct a unique
BT or not
NOTE : in this when inorder is not given out of those two then we can not 
construct a unique BT , otherwise we can construct so many Binary Trees
just think in the traversal manner
whichever it is left root right or any other of those 2
