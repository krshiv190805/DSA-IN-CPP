in this we will see how to represent in c++
 likewise we do in linked list
 suppose there is 
 5 so 5 have two pointer one is pointing to the right child node
 and left is pointing to next child node
 and so on , if there is a leaf node its right and left would be 
 pointing to null;
 now we are making a tree using code
 :
 struct Node{
 int data;
 Struct Node*left;
 Struct Node*Right;
 Node(int val){
 data=val
 left=right=null;
 }
 main(){
 Struct Node*root=new Node(1);
 root->left=new Node(2);
 root->right=new Node(3);
 root->left->right=new Node(5);
 }
