    in this we will understand about the bfs/dfs
   these all are types of DFS
    1)inorder traversal(left root right)
    2)pre-order(root left right)
    3)post-order traversal(left right root)
1) means first go to the extreme left sub tree and do left root right
then write the main root then go to the extreme right sub tree and again do the same thing left root right
 2)first the root then again the left sub tree then 
 again root left right  and go to the right sub tree after completion of left tree
 then again root left right
 3) first good to the left sub tree
 then left right root and then go to the right sub tree after completion and then
 do the same thing left right root
 and then main root at the top

 IMP: 
 to remember all these 
 In means root in betweeen 
 Pre means root is first 
 Post means root is at last 
 and left right order is maintained during all 
 these traversals
 
 now we will talk about BFS
 the level wise traversal just write all the data present in the nodes
 level by level
