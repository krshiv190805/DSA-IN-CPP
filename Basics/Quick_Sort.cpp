    This is quick sort algorithm
    1) pick a pivot( basically an element from the array , it can be 
    either 1st element,last,median of the array or any random element and now place it 
    in the correct sorted manner in the array and follow this step again and again)
    steps:
    take the pivot and place it in the right position when array is sorted
    now check the elements which are less and greater than it 
    now arrange them accordingly
    then two arrays will be there one to left of pivot and another on right
    again apply quick sort in the same way , it will be sorted at the end

    the code goes like :
    int partition(vector<int>&arr,int low,int high){
    int pivot=arr[low];
    int i
    }
    
    
    */
 return 0;
