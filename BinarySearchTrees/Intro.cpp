/*
in this , there was only introduction about what are BST's
left side of root is less and right side is greater than the primary root
otherwise it can't be a BST
and searching in this takes O(logN)
as it seems like a binary search kind of thing , if element is less or greater 
we can reduce the half of searching area then again the same and so on
NOTE : duplicates are usually not allowed but some books say it is allowed (but we will not take here)
